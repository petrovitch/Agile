Changes:
Remove "Grid" for main body of page - wasn't really using it anyway.
* (Need to clean up meeting.css if we're not going to use grid)
Reset default meeting and meeting time that I had accidently left changes I'd made in dev in.
Larger than a certain screen size now creates two columns of each type/role of attendees.
* 2020-08-21 09:19 AM Noticing peoples reaction it might be nice to highlight the person 
speaking, and maybe gray Edward's name so we know he is there, but he's in the background 
so people won't consider calling on him.
