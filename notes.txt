Remove "Grid" for main body of page - wasn't really using it anyway.
* (Need to clean up meeting.css if we're not going to use grid)
Reset default meeting and meeting time that I had accidently left changes I'd made in dev in.
Larger than a certain screen size now creates two columns of each type/role of attendees.
