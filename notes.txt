Changes:
Remove "Grid" for main body of page - wasn't really using it anyway.
* (Need to clean up meeting.css if we're not going to use grid)
Reset default meeting and meeting time that I had accidently left changes I'd made in dev in.
Larger than a certain screen size now creates two columns of each type/role of attendees.
* 2020-08-21 09:19 AM Noticing peoples reaction it might be nice to highlight the person 
speaking, and maybe gray Edward's name so we know he is there, but he's in the background 
so people won't consider calling on him.
* 2020-09-22 09:08 AM It would be nice to add a poll for response to questions like today: 
Should we extend the sprint? Then very quickly without conversation we could have a vote.
Not even bother with a subject.  Just a quick poll of attendees.
* 2020-09-28 07:36 AM I've been studying for the Scrum Master Certification.  Scored 98% 
on their practice exam.  I'll probably study a few more weekends before taking the actual
exam(s).  There are two exams: Certified Scrum Master (CSM) that requires
a two day class and costs nearly $700, but it's easier to pass; and PSM1 Scrum Certification
that costs $150 and is more difficult to pass.  Anyway, if I pass these exam(s) and get
Richard's and Alfred's approval then there are several changes that need to take place.
First, the daily scrum is not for management or the Product Owner.  Like Edward from
Customer Service, they can be in the meeting as observers.  Richard, on the otherhand,
is a developer too so he should be removed from the top of the list and randomized
with the rest of development.

Scrum has no rule against holding other meetings so technically as the Daily Scrum ends
then another meeting of Product Owner and Managemnt can begin where Edward, Alfred, and
Richard can participate.

I setup other Scrum meetings that may be developed later, i.e., Scrum Planning, 
Scrum Review, Scrum Retrospective, and Product Backlog Refinement.
